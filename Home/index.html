    <h2>Personal</h2>
    <p id="personal" class="personal">When I found Aries he was a relatively small artist. <br> I've been a huge fan of his work since 2019 when he released welcome home. There's a tattoo on my right arm which symbolizes him and his music and the inspiration and hope it makes me feel every-time I listen. <br> His music helped me get through the worst part of my life so far and made me remember to keep my head up. Sadly there's no way for me to thank him and I haven't even been to any of his concerts. Unfortunately I missed his europe tour but I'm hoping I'll be able to make it to one of his concerts eventually :) </p>
